<div><b>AWS Well-Architected and the six pillars</b></div><div>The AWS Well-Architected Framework serves as a guiding methodology for
architects and developers to design and evaluate cloud architectures
based on best practices established by AWS. At its core, the framework
comprises six pillars: Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency,
Cost Optimization, Operational Excellence, and Sustainability. Each
pillar represents a fundamental aspect of a well-architected system and
provides guidelines for building robust, scalable, and efficient cloud
solutions.</div><h3 data-label="security" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Security</h3><div>Security is a foundational pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework,
emphasizing the importance of implementing robust security measures to
protect data, systems, and assets. Key considerations include [3]:</div><ul><li><b>Encryption</b> : Encrypting data at rest and in transit using
industry-standard encryption algorithms and key management practices.</li><li><b>Identity and Access Management (IAM)</b> : Implementing least
privilege access, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and strong
password policies to control access to AWS resources.</li><li><b>Network Security</b> : Configuring firewalls, security groups, and
network ACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic, and leveraging
AWS services like AWS WAF and AWS Shield for DDoS protection.</li><li><b>Logging and Monitoring</b> : Utilizing AWS CloudTrail for auditing
API calls, Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring system activity, and AWS
Config for tracking resource configurations.</li></ul><div><i>Example Scenario</i> : A financial institution migrating its
infrastructure to AWS must ensure compliance with industry regulations
such as PCI DSS and GDPR. By implementing robust encryption, access
controls, and logging mechanisms, the institution can safeguard
sensitive customer data and maintain regulatory compliance.</div>
