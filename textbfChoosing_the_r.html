<div><b>Choosing the right resources</b></div><div>Optimizing performance starts with selecting the right resource types
and sizes based on workload requirements. AWS offers a diverse range of
instance types and sizes that cater to various use cases—from
compute-optimized instances like C5 and C6g for CPU-intensive
applications to memory-optimized instances like R5 and X1 for
memory-heavy applications. Selecting the appropriate instance type
ensures that the workload performs as efficiently as possible, reducing
unnecessary costs associated with over-provisioning.</div><div><b>Real-Life use case: Financial services firm</b> Consider a
financial services firm that uses AWS to power real-time fraud detection
systems. These systems analyze transactions in milliseconds to identify
potential fraud. The firm utilizes Amazon SageMaker to build, train, and
deploy machine learning models that continuously learn and adapt to new
fraudulent patterns. For data processing and analysis, they use AWS
Lambda for serverless compute, which scales automatically and ensures
they only pay for the compute time they consume. They also leverage
Amazon Kinesis for real-time data streaming, ensuring that the
transaction data is processed quickly and efficiently.</div><div>To support the high-performance computing needs of machine learning
model training, the firm uses Amazon EC2 P4 instances, which are
specifically designed for machine learning and high-performance
computing workloads. These instances provide GPU-based parallel compute
capabilities, significantly reducing the time required to train complex
models.</div>
