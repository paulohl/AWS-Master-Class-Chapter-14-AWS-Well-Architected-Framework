<div><b>Architectural patterns and services</b></div><div>High availability and fault tolerance are about designing systems that
are always operational and can withstand and recover from failures.
Essential strategies include:</div><div><b>Multi-AZ and multi-region deployments</b> : Deploy applications
across multiple Availability Zones and even regions to ensure service
continuity in case of a zone or regional failure.</div><div><b>Backup and disaster recovery</b> : Use Amazon RDS which
automatically takes snapshots and backups to streamline recovery
processes. Implement AWS Backup to centrally manage backups across AWS
services.</div><div><b>Use case</b> : A financial services firm uses Amazon RDS with
Multi-AZ deployments for its transaction databases to ensure seamless
failover to a standby instance if the primary instance fails. They also
deploy their application stack in multiple regions to provide service
continuity in case of regional disruptions.</div><h3 data-label="cost-optimization-2" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Cost Optimization</h3>
