<div><b>Principles of cost optimization</b></div><div>Cost optimization on AWS revolves around several key principles:</div><ul><li><b>Right-sizing resources</b> to ensure that you’re using the
optimal configurations for your workload needs.</li><li><b>Using pricing models</b> that match your usage patterns, such as
Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, and Spot Instances.</li><li><b>Monitoring and tracking usage</b> to identify and eliminate waste
through detailed billing and cost management tools.</li></ul><div><b>Real-life use case: Tech startup</b> A tech startup specializing in
data analytics has fluctuating computational needs based on client
projects and data processing loads. Initially, they utilized on-demand
instances which led to high costs. To optimize costs, they transitioned
to a combination of Reserved Instances and Spot Instances. Reserved
Instances provided them with a significant discount (up to 75% compared
to on-demand pricing) for steady-state base workloads, while Spot
Instances allowed them to save up to 90% on the compute cost for their
flexible, non-critical batch processing jobs. By implementing AWS Cost
Explorer, they could track and analyze their spending patterns, further
optimizing costs by identifying unused resources and right sizing their
instances.</div>
