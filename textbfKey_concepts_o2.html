<div><b>Key concepts of the performance efficiency lens</b></div><ul><li><b>Compute optimization</b> : Adjusting compute resources to match
the load, using auto-scaling to handle changes in demand, and
optimizing the code to improve performance.</li><li><b>Storage optimization</b> : Selecting storage solutions that match
the performance and durability requirements of the applications they
support.</li><li><b>Database optimization</b> : Ensuring that databases are designed
to handle their workload efficiently, with appropriate indexing, query
optimization, and scaling strategies.</li></ul>
