<div><b>Applications of Well-Architected Lenses</b></div><div>Architects use these lenses during the design, migration, and
optimization phases of application development to ensure that their AWS
environments are aligned with best practices specific to their business
needs. For instance, a financial services firm will find Financial
Services Lens particularly useful for addressing compliance and security
requirements unique to the financial sector.</div><h2 data-label="security-lens" class="ltx_title_subsection">Security Lens</h2><div>The Security Lens of the AWS Well-Architected Framework focuses on
ensuring that cloud architectures are designed to protect data, systems,
and assets from potential security threats. Key considerations include:</div><ul><li><b>Identity and access management (IAM)</b> : Implementing least
privilege access, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and strong
password policies.</li><li><b>Encryption</b> : Encrypting data at rest and in transit using
industry-standard encryption algorithms and key management practices.</li><li>Network Security: Configuring firewalls, security groups, and network
ACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic.</li></ul><div><i>Application scenario</i><b>:</b> A healthcare organization
migrating its patient data to the cloud must ensure compliance with
HIPAA regulations. By applying the Security Lens, the organization
implements robust encryption mechanisms, access controls, and audit
trails to protect patient confidentiality and maintain regulatory
compliance.</div>
