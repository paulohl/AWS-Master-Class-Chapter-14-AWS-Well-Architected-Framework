<div><b>Closing Thoughts on Reliability</b></div><div>Adhering to AWS’s best practices for reliability allows organizations to
maintain operational performance while minimizing the impact on
customers during outages and failures. The combination of these
approaches contributes significantly to achieving the desired levels of
reliability, thereby ensuring that systems are resilient, meet user
expectations, and maintain business continuity.</div><h3 data-label="performance-efficiency" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Performance Efficiency</h3><div>Performance Efficiency aims to optimize resource utilization and
maximize system throughput to meet workload demands efficiently. Key
considerations include [5]:</div><ul><li><b>Compute Optimization</b> : Right-sizing EC2 instances, leveraging
AWS Auto Scaling for dynamic resource allocation, and optimizing
application code for performance.</li><li><b>Storage Optimization</b> : Choosing the appropriate storage
classes based on access patterns and durability requirements and
implementing data caching strategies using Amazon ElastiCache.</li><li><b>Database Optimization</b> : Utilizing Amazon RDS for managed
database services, optimizing query performance, and implementing read
replicas for read-heavy workloads.</li></ul><div><i>Example scenario</i> : A media streaming service must deliver
high-quality video content to users worldwide with minimal latency. By
leveraging AWS CloudFront for content delivery, Amazon Aurora for
scalable databases, and Amazon CloudWatch for performance monitoring,
the service ensures optimal user experience across geographically
dispersed regions.</div>
