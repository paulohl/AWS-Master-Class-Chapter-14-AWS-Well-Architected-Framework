<div><b>Using AWS budgets and cost management tools</b></div><div>AWS Budgets allows the startup to set custom cost and usage budgets that
alert them when they exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) their budgeted
amount. This tool helps them stay within their financial plan without
the need for constant manual oversight.</div><div><b>Application scenario: Non-profit organization</b> Consider a
non-profit organization that provides educational resources globally.
They need a cost-effective solution to handle unpredictable spikes in
demand, especially during global events or campaigns. They decide to
migrate to AWS, utilizing serverless architectures like AWS Lambda,
Amazon S3, and Amazon DynamoDB.</div><div>Serverless computing is particularly beneficial for them because it
enables them to pay only for the compute time they consume with no
server costs, which significantly lowers operational expenses. AWS
Lambda automatically scales the computational capacity by running code
in response to each trigger, ensuring they only use resources when the
functions are called. Amazon S3 and DynamoDB also offer scalable storage
and database services, charging only for the storage used and the
read/write operations performed, respectively.</div>
