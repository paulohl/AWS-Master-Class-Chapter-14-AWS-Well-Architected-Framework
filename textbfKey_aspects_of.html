<div><b>Key aspects of operational excellence</b></div><ul><li><b>Automation</b> : Leveraging AWS tools to automate manual
processes, reduce the potential for human error, and increase
efficiency.</li><li><b>Monitoring and logging</b> : Utilizing AWS monitoring tools to
track and manage system performance in real-time.</li><li><b>Continuous improvement</b> : Adopting a culture of experimentation
and iterative improvements to processes and systems.</li></ul><div><b>Real-life use case: International bank</b> An international bank,
aiming to enhance its agility and speed of innovation, turned to AWS to
overhaul its operational processes. They automated their AWS operations
by integrating a range of AWS services, including AWS CloudFormation for
infrastructure as code, which allowed them to quickly provision and
manage resources in an organized and predictable manner.</div><div>For continuous integration and deployment, they implemented AWS
CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild. This automation enabled them to
streamline the deployment process, from code commit through to build and
production deployment, greatly reducing the turnaround time for new
application features and updates.</div><div>To ensure the operational stability and performance optimization of
their AWS environment, the bank employed AWS CloudWatch alongside AWS
X-Ray. These services provided them with detailed insights into their
application performance and the underlying AWS services, enabling
proactive incident response and fine-grained debugging and tracing of
microservices.</div><div><b>Application scenario: Media company</b> Consider a media company
that manages a content delivery network (CDN) to distribute digital
content globally. As viewer demand shifts rapidly—often spiking during
major events or new content releases—the company needs an elastic
solution to adjust resources efficiently.</div><div>To manage this, the company could employ Amazon CloudFront integrated
with AWS Lambda@Edge for real-time modifications to content delivery
based on viewer demand. By using Lambda@Edge, they can run code closer
to users’ locations, reducing latency and improving the user experience
without managing servers.</div><div>Additionally, they implement Amazon CloudWatch and AWS Auto Scaling to
monitor their systems and automatically adjust the capacity of their
resources to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest
possible cost. For instance, during a new series release, Auto Scaling
ensures that their EC2 instances scale up to handle increased traffic,
and scale down automatically during off-peak hours to reduce costs.</div>
