<div><b>Detailed implementation with application examples</b></div><ul><li><b>Compute optimization</b> :</li><li><b>Principle</b> : Compute optimization involves assessing the
compute needs of applications and ensuring that the resources align
with those needs dynamically. This can mean choosing different types
or sizes of instances based on the workload or employing
auto-scaling to adjust resources as demand changes.</li><li><b>Real-life use case</b> : An online gaming company uses Amazon
EC2 instances for their game servers. During peak playing times,
they utilize EC2 Auto Scaling to automatically add more instances to
maintain gameplay smoothness and responsiveness. They also use AWS
Lambda for certain backend tasks to handle sudden spikes without
provisioning additional EC2 resources.</li><li><b>Storage optimization</b> :</li><li><b>Principle</b> : Efficient storage involves selecting the right
type of storage based on how data is accessed and stored. Using AWS,
you can choose from options like Amazon S3 for object storage, EBS
for block storage, or Amazon EFS for file storage depending on
access patterns.</li><li><b>Real-life use case</b> : A financial analytics firm implements
Amazon S3 for storing historical financial data, which is
infrequently accessed but requires high durability. For real-time
transaction data, they use Amazon EBS with Provisioned IOPS to
ensure fast access times and strong I/O performance.</li><li><b>Database optimization</b> :</li><li><b>Principle</b> : Database optimization focuses on ensuring that
the database configuration matches the use case, optimizing how data
is retrieved and stored to enhance performance. Techniques include
fine-tuning queries, using appropriate indexing, and choosing the
right database service.</li><li><b>Real-life use case</b> : A retail company uses Amazon Aurora for
their transactional database needs. Aurora provides the performance
and availability of high-end commercial databases at a lower cost.
They utilize Aurora’s replication capabilities to scale read
operations across multiple instances and use automated query
optimization to ensure efficient data retrieval.</li></ul><div><b>Application scenario: Media streaming service</b> Consider a media
streaming service that needs to deliver high-quality video content to a
global audience with minimal latency. The performance efficiency of
their system is crucial for user satisfaction and service success.</div><ul><li><b>Compute optimization</b> : The service employs AWS Auto Scaling in
conjunction with Amazon EC2 Spot Instances to manage compute capacity
and costs effectively. During peak hours, such as new movie releases
or live events, Auto Scaling adjusts the number of instances to handle
increased demand without manual intervention.</li><li><b>Storage optimization</b> : They use Amazon S3 for storing static
content like video files, taking advantage of S3’s durability and
scalability. To reduce latency, they implement Amazon CloudFront as
their CDN, caching content at edge locations closest to the users.</li><li><b>Database optimization</b> : The service utilizes Amazon RDS with
read replicas to enhance database access speeds during high-query
periods. They also employ Amazon ElastiCache to cache frequent
database queries, reducing the load on the database and speeding up
the retrieval of content metadata.</li></ul>
