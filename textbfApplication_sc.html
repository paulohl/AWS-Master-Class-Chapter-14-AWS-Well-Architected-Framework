<div><b>Application scenario: SaaS provider</b></div><div>Consider a SaaS provider specializing in digital marketing tools that
require high availability and robust performance. The provider uses
several AWS services to optimize their operational workflows under the
guidance of the Operational Excellence Lens.</div><ul><li><b>Automation</b> : The company automates their deployment pipelines
using AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodePipeline, allowing for smooth,
continuous integration and delivery cycles. This automation not only
speeds up deployments but also ensures that each deployment is
executed under controlled and repeatable conditions.</li><li><b>Monitoring and observability</b> : They implement Amazon
CloudWatch to monitor their system’s performance and set up dashboards
that provide a unified view of their operations. This allows them to
observe application behavior in real-time and make informed decisions
quickly.</li><li><b>Incident response</b> : The provider establishes a robust incident
response protocol, where AWS CloudTrail is used to log and monitor all
account activity. In the event of an incident, automated processes are
triggered to mitigate the impact, followed by a detailed analysis to
prevent future occurrences.</li></ul>
