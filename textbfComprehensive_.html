<div><b>Comprehensive Monitoring</b></div><div>AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config are pivotal for monitoring AWS
environments. CloudTrail enables governance, compliance, operational
auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account by logging all events
and API calls across your AWS infrastructure. AWS Config provides a
detailed inventory of your AWS resources and allows you to audit changes
in configurations and relationships between AWS resources, helping to
ensure that all activities are logged, and any configuration change can
trigger alerts.</div>
