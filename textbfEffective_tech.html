<div><b>Effective techniques for cost management</b></div><div>Achieving cost optimization involves understanding and controlling where
money is being spent and ensuring that every dollar spent contributes to
business value. Techniques include:</div><ul><li><b>Resource tagging and cost allocation</b> : Implement detailed
tagging for resources to track costs at a granular level, enabling
effective cost management and accountability.</li><li><b>Right-sizing resources</b> : Regularly review and adjust the size
and type of AWS resources using AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Trusted
Advisor to ensure you are not paying for unused or underutilized

Instances for predictable, steady-state workloads and use Spot
Instances for flexible, interruptible tasks to save costs
significantly.</li></ul><div><b>Use case</b> : An e-commerce company implements a sophisticated cost
management strategy by using AWS Budgets to set cost and usage budgets

departments and projects, facilitating precise chargeback and show back
processes.</div><h3 data-label="wrap-up-1" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Wrap up!</h3><div>These expanded discussions provide a deeper understanding of the
