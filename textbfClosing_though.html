<div><b>Closing thoughts on performance efficiency</b></div><div>By leveraging AWS’s vast array of services and tools designed for
performance optimization, organizations can ensure that their
applications are not just meeting current demands but are also prepared
to scale efficiently and cost-effectively in response to future growth.
This strategic approach to performance efficiency helps maintain an
agile, responsive, and robust technological infrastructure.</div><h3 data-label="cost-optimization" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Cost optimization</h3><div>Cost optimization focuses on maximizing resource efficiency and
minimizing operational expenses without compromising performance or
reliability. Key considerations include [6]:</div><ul><li><b>Resource tagging</b> : Tagging AWS resources to track usage,
allocate costs, and identify opportunities for optimization.</li><li><b>Reserved instances</b> : Purchasing reserved capacity for EC2
instances, RDS databases, and other AWS services to reduce costs.</li><li><b>Usage analysis</b> : Analyzing usage patterns, identifying idle
resources, and implementing automation for resource scheduling and
termination.</li></ul><div><i>Example scenario</i> : A startup with limited budget
constraints seeks to minimize cloud costs while scaling its
infrastructure. By implementing cost allocation tags, leveraging AWS
Cost Explorer for cost analysis, and optimizing EC2 usage with Reserved
Instances, the company can optimize spending and allocate resources
efficiently.</div>
