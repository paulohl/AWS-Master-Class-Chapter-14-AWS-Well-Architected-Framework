<div><b>Deep Dive into Encryption</b></div><div>Encryption is the cornerstone of data security in cloud computing. AWS
offers comprehensive solutions for encrypting data at rest and in
transit. For instance, Amazon S3 provides built-in encryption features
where users can automatically encrypt their data when it is stored. AWS
Key Management Service (KMS) allows for easy management of encryption
keys, enabling users to control access to their data across AWS
services.</div><div><b>Real-life use case: Global E-commerce Company</b> Consider a global
e-commerce platform that handles sensitive customer information,
including payment data. To meet PCI DSS compliance, the company utilizes
AWS services such as Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS, both configured to
encrypt data at rest using AWS KMS. The encryption keys are rotated
regularly, adding an additional layer of security and complexity for
potential attackers.</div><div><b>Application scenario: Healthcare Startup</b> Imagine a startup in
the healthcare sector looking to deploy a new patient management system
on AWS. To comply with HIPAA regulations, the startup employs AWS IAM to
manage access rights strictly and uses Amazon VPC to isolate their
resources within a private network. Each data transfer is encrypted
using TLS, and all sensitive patient data is encrypted at rest using AWS
KMS, with keys managed under stringent policies.</div>
