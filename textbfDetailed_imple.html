<div><b>Detailed implementation with application examples</b></div><ul><li><b>IAM best practices</b> :</li><li><b>Principle</b> : Applying the principle of least privilege to
minimize potential pathways to sensitive data or systems.</li><li><b>Real-life use case</b> : A multinational corporation uses AWS
IAM to manage granular permissions for over 10,000 users globally,
utilizing conditions and context keys to refine access controls
according to the department, job function, and region.</li><li><b>Data protection techniques</b> :</li><li><b>Principle</b> : Utilizing AWS KMS for key management and Amazon
S3 bucket policies for securing data storage.</li><li><b>Real-life use case</b> : A healthcare application uses AWS KMS
to manage encryption keys for its patient data stored in Amazon S3,
ensuring HIPAA compliance through encrypted storage and controlled
access.</li><li><b>Infrastructure protection</b> :</li><li><b>Principle</b> : Implementing security groups and network ACLs as
firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance
and subnet level.</li><li><b>Real-life use case</b> : An e-commerce platform configures
security groups to restrict inbound traffic to only allow HTTPS,
protecting their web servers from unwanted exposures.</li><li><b>Detective controls</b> :</li><li><b>Principle</b> : The importance of real-time monitoring and
logging to provide visibility into system operations and potential
security threats.</li><li><b>Real-life use case</b> : A financial services firm implements
AWS CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch to monitor API calls and
network traffic, enabling them to detect and respond to unauthorized
transaction attempts immediately.</li><li><b>Incident response</b> :</li><li><b>Principle</b> : Having a well-defined incident response plan
that includes incident identification, isolation, eradication, and
recovery processes.</li><li><b>Real-life use case</b> : An online gaming company has automated
response protocols using AWS Lambda to isolate compromised instances
and replace them without human intervention, minimizing downtime and
impact on users.</li></ul>
