<div><b>Optimizing performance with caching</b></div><div>Caching is another critical strategy for enhancing performance. AWS
provides Amazon ElastiCache, which supports Redis and Memcached, to
cache frequent queries and save the time and cost of fetching data from
databases. This is particularly useful for read-heavy application
workloads and can significantly improve response times.</div><div><b>Application scenario: Video game company</b> Imagine a video game
company developing a cloud-based gaming service that requires high
network performance, low latency, and high throughput to deliver a
seamless gaming experience. To minimize latency, the company uses AWS
Global Accelerator, which directs user traffic to the nearest AWS edge
location, thus improving the connectivity and speed that gamers
experience worldwide.</div><div>For global data synchronization and state management across all game
sessions, the company implements Amazon DynamoDB, which provides fast
and predictable performance with seamless scalability. To handle sudden
spikes in gaming traffic, especially during new game launches or live
events, the company uses AWS Auto Scaling alongside Amazon EC2 Spot
Instances, which allow them to scale computing capacity and manage costs
effectively.</div>
