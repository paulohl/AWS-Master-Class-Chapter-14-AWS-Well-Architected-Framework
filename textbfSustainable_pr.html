<div><b>Sustainable practices in Cloud computing</b></div><div>The focus on sustainability within AWS encompasses several key
practices:</div><ul><li><b>Server utilization and energy efficiency</b> : AWS aims to
maximize the energy efficiency of their data centers and improve
server utilization rates, which directly contributes to reducing
waste.</li><li><b>Renewable energy usage</b> : AWS is increasingly investing in
renewable energy projects to power their data centers, aiming for more
sustainable energy sources over traditional fossil fuels.</li><li><b>Resource optimization</b> : AWS provides tools that help customers
optimize resource allocation to ensure they are only consuming what is
necessary and reducing wastage.</li></ul><div><b>Real-life use case: Major online retailer</b> A major online
retailer has committed to reducing its environmental impact through more
sustainable cloud practices. Utilizing AWS, the retailer leverages the
AWS Sustainability Pillar to identify and implement improvements across
their cloud infrastructure. This includes moving to regions that are
more carbon-neutral, powered predominantly by renewable energy sources.</div><div>Additionally, the retailer uses Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the
efficiency of their resource utilization. By analyzing usage patterns,
they can identify over-provisioned resources and scale down, which not
only saves costs but also decreases energy consumption. They also engage
in serverless architectures like AWS Lambda, which automatically adjusts
computing resource allocation without the need for running idle server
instances, thereby optimizing energy use.</div><div><b>Application scenario: SaaS provider</b> Imagine a new Software as a
Service (SaaS) provider that designs its services with sustainability as
a core value. To align with this goal, the company chooses AWS for its
well-known commitment to sustainability and its suite of tools that
facilitate efficient energy management.</div><div>The provider utilizes AWS Elastic Beanstalk for deploying and managing
applications which automatically handles the capacity provisioning, load
balancing, and auto-scaling. This ensures that the infrastructure scales
up only when needed and scales down during idle periods, significantly
reducing unnecessary energy use.</div><div>For data storage, they opt for Amazon S3, which provides storage classes
like S3 Intelligent-Tiering that automatically moves data to the most
cost-effective access tier based on usage patterns. This not only
optimizes costs but also aligns with their goal to minimize energy usage
by reducing the need to access and power physical drives frequently.</div><div>Moreover, the provider takes advantage of the AWS Carbon Footprint Tool,
which gives insights into the carbon emissions associated with their AWS
usage. This tool helps them track and aim to reduce their carbon
footprint systematically, making decisions that support their
sustainability goals.</div>
