<div><b>Best practices</b></div><ol><li><b>Security best practices</b> :</li><li>Implement a multi-layered security architecture using Amazon VPC,
Security Groups, and Network ACLs to ensure that each component is
isolated and protected.</li><li>Utilize AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to enforce
principle of least privilege by granting minimum necessary
permissions to users and services.</li><li>Regularly audit security configurations and permissions with AWS
Config and AWS CloudTrail to maintain compliance and enhance
security posture.</li><li><b>Performance optimization</b> :</li><li>Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor application and infrastructure
performance in real time, setting alarms to proactively address
potential bottlenecks.</li><li>Employ elastic scaling with AWS Auto Scaling and Amazon EC2 Spot
Instances to manage load dynamically and cost-effectively.</li><li>Optimize data storage and retrieval by selecting appropriate
database services like Amazon RDS, DynamoDB, or Amazon Redshift
based on specific access patterns and workload requirements.</li><li><b>Cost management</b> :</li><li>Leverage AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets to monitor and control
AWS spending, setting alerts to avoid cost overruns.</li><li>Implement tagging strategies to allocate costs accurately across
different departments or projects, facilitating chargeback and show
back models.</li><li>Optimize resource usage by right-sizing services and adopting
cost-effective resource types like Amazon S3 Glacier for long-term
data storage or AWS Lambda for event-driven, serverless computing.</li></ol>
