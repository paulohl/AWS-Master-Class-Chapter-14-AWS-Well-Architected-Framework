<div><b>Closing thoughts on the performance efficiency lens</b></div><div>The AWS Well-Architected performance efficiency lens provides a detailed
framework for maximizing resource utilization and enhancing system
throughput. By applying the strategies and best practices outlined in
this lens, organizations can ensure their AWS deployments are not only
performing at their peak but also are cost-effective and scalable.</div><h2 data-label="cost-optimization-lens" class="ltx_title_subsection">Cost optimization lens</h2><div>The Cost Optimization Lens focuses on maximizing resource efficiency and
minimizing operational expenses without compromising performance or
reliability. Key considerations include:</div><ul><li>Resource tagging: Tagging AWS resources to track usage and identify
opportunities for optimization.</li><li>Reserved capacity: Purchasing reserved instances and capacity
commitments to reduce costs.</li><li>Usage Analysis: Analyzing usage patterns and implementing cost-saving
strategies such as spot instances and serverless architectures.</li></ul><div><i>Example scenario</i> : A startup company with limited budget
constraints leverages Cost Optimization Lens to minimize cloud
expenditures while scaling its infrastructure. By implementing cost
allocation tags, utilizing reserved capacity, and optimizing resource
usage, the company optimizes spending and maximizes ROI.</div>
