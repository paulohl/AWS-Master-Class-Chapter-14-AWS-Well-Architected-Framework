<div><b>Deep dive into system monitoring and predictive scaling</b></div><div>System monitoring is another cornerstone of reliability. AWS CloudWatch
allows teams to monitor their resources and applications, providing
detailed visibility into the architecture’s performance. CloudWatch
alarms can notify teams of potential issues before they cause system
failures. Furthermore, AWS Predictive Scaling forecasts future traffic,
including spikes, using machine learning models and schedules
appropriate scaling actions, ensuring that the system meets customer
demands without manual intervention.</div><div><b>Application scenario: Online Education Platform</b> Imagine an
online education platform that must remain available particularly during
exam periods, demand spikes significantly. They implement AWS Auto
Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing to manage this demand effectively.
Auto Scaling adjusts resources based on real-time traffic data, ensuring
that the infrastructure can handle sudden increases in user load without
manual intervention. Elastic Load Balancing, meanwhile, distributes
traffic across all available instances to avoid overloading any single
server and to ensure smooth, consistent performance across the platform.
Additionally, they utilize Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ deployments for
their databases to ensure that the database layer remains highly
available and resilient to DB instance failover.</div>
