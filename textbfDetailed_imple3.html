<div><b>Detailed implementation with application examples</b></div><ul><li><b>Resource tagging</b> :</li><li><b>Principle</b> : Effective resource tagging allows organizations
to attribute AWS costs to specific departments, projects, or
services, making it easier to manage budgets and ensure fiscal
responsibility.</li><li><b>Real-life use case</b> : A multinational corporation implements
a comprehensive tagging strategy where every EC2 instance, S3
bucket, and RDS database is tagged with cost center, department, and
project code tags. This enables their finance team to generate
detailed monthly reports that show which departments or projects are
driving costs, leading to more informed budgeting decisions.</li><li><b>Reserved capacity</b> :</li><li><b>Principle</b> : Reserved Instances (RIs) and Savings Plans offer
a significant discount (up to 72%) over standard on-demand instance
pricing in exchange for a commitment to use a specific number of
resources for a one or three-year term.</li><li><b>Real-life use case</b> : An online retail company experiences
consistent and predictable workloads on their e-commerce platform.
By purchasing EC2 Reserved Instances for their web servers and RDS
Reserved Instances for their transaction databases, they reduce
their operational costs by up to 60%.</li><li><b>Usage Analysis</b> :</li><li><b>Principle</b> : Regular analysis of resource usage helps
identify underutilized resources, which can be right-sized or shut
down to save costs. Techniques include analyzing performance metrics
to find opportunities for downsizing or moving to a less expensive
resource.</li><li><b>Real-life use case</b> : A software development company uses AWS
Cost Explorer to monitor their AWS spending and usage patterns. They
identify several underutilized EC2 instances that were oversized
based on their actual computing needs. By right sizing these
instances, they achieve substantial cost savings without impacting
performance.</li></ul><div><b>Application scenario: Startup company</b> Consider a tech startup
that is rapidly scaling but also needs to manage its limited budget
effectively. They prioritize cost optimization to ensure their growth
does not lead to unsustainable expenses.</div><ul><li><b>Resource tagging</b> : The startup implements detailed tagging for
all their resources, categorizing them by team and environment
(development, staging, production). This allows them to track exactly
where their cloud spend is going and identify areas where costs can be
reduced.</li><li><b>Reserved capacity</b> : Knowing their base level of compute and
database needs are stable and predictable, the startup invests in
Reserved Instances for their core services, which drastically cuts
their ongoing cloud costs.</li><li><b>Usage analysis</b> : They regularly review their AWS usage with
AWS Cost Explorer, identifying peak usage times and underutilized
resources. They implement AWS Auto Scaling to adjust their resource
levels dynamically, increasing during peak times and decreasing during
off-hours. Additionally, they use AWS Lambda for asynchronous tasks to
further reduce costs by paying only for the compute time used.</li></ul>
