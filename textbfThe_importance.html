<div><b>The importance of fault tolerance and failover strategies</b></div><div>Fault tolerance is critical in designing reliable systems. AWS
encourages the use of decoupled components where possible, so failures
in one area do not cascade to others. Using services like Amazon RDS
Multi-AZ deployments or Amazon S3’s cross-region replication can ensure
that if one instance or one data center fails, the process or data
remains available using the replicated resources in another location.</div><div><b>Real-life use case: Major streaming service</b> Consider a major
streaming service that experiences millions of simultaneous streams
during popular live events. To handle this, they employ Amazon EC2 Auto
Scaling and Amazon CloudFront to manage the load. EC2 Auto Scaling
automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances up or down according
to conditions defined for the load, while CloudFront delivers content
from the nearest edge location to minimize latency and manage more users
efficiently. Additionally, they utilize AWS Elastic Load Balancing to
distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2
instances, containers, and IP addresses, in multiple Availability Zones,
which increases the fault tolerance of the application.</div>
